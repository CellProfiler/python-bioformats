Python-bioformats is a Python wrapper for Bio-Formats, a standalone
Java library for reading and writing life sciences image file
formats. Bio-Formats is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata
for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several
formats. Python-bioformats uses the python-javabridge to start a Java
virtual machine from Python and interact with it. Python-bioformats
was developed for and is used by the cell image analysis software
CellProfiler (cellprofiler.org).
